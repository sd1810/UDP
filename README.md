# UDP
Steps to run the Program

1. Run UDPServer.java
2. Run UDPClient. java
3. From client terminal send messages to the server.
4. Check if sent data is received by the server.
5. Terminate by sending bye.

#### This is a simple implementation of one-sided client-server program wherein the client sends messages to server and server just prints it until the client sends “bye” using UDP.
